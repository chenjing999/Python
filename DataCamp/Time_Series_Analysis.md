## Time Series Analysis in Python
Intro:
Time series data is one of the most common data types and understanding how to work with it is a critical data science skill if you want to make predictions and report on trends. 

-- manipulate time series data using pandas, work with statistical libraries including NumPy and statsmodels to analyze data

-- develop your visualization skills using Matplotlib, SciPy, and seaborn. 

-- apply time series skills using real-world data, including:

financial stock data

UFO sightings

CO2 levels in Maui

monthly candy production in the US

heartbeat sounds. 

--forecast the future using ARIMA class models and generate predictions and insights using machine learning models.
